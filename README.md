# REST_API_SpringBoot_Client

This is a simple REST API project built to practice and upgrate skills of developming REST API applications with Spring Boot and Hibernate. The project provides CRUD operations for two entities: Club and Player.

The Club entity represents a football club with a name, country, and list of players. 
The Player entity represents a football player with a name, surname, age, nationality, salary, and a reference to the club they belong to.

The API provides endpoints for reading, creating, updating, and deleting clubs and players. It also provides additional endpoint for retrieving all players belonging to a specific club.

The project uses MySQL as the database and includes Hibernate annotations for mapping entities to the database tables. It also includes DTO for representing entities in the API responses.

What I Learned: 

    Building REST APIs with Spring Boot
    Architecture of REST APIs
    Handling global HTTP exceptions
    Using Lombok annotations

What I Improve:

    Implementing CRUD operations with Spring Data JPA
    Improving the overall code structure and organization
    Gained experience with each technology that was used


Overall, this project provides a basic example of building a REST API with Spring Boot and Hibernate, and for me it is good starting point for more complex projects.
